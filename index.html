                <h1>Some of My Favorite Places to Visit</h1>
                    <h2>Cardinal Games</h2>
                    <a id="busch_stadium"></a>
                    <p>Busch Stadium, St. Louis, MO</p>
                    <p>It's always a good idea to catch a Cardinals game when they are in town.  Hard to find a bad seat here. There is pleanty of food and drinks to choose from.</p>

                        </a>
                    <h2>Great Snack</h2>    
                    <a id="gus_pretzels"></a>
                    <p>Gus' Pretzels, St. Louis, MO</p>
                    <p>When you are near the Anheiser Busch Brewery you should stop in at Gus's pretzels for a quick snack. They taste the best when they are freash and hot.</p>

                        </a>
                    <h2>The Best BLT</h2>
                    <a id="crown_candy"></a>
                    <p>Crown Candy, St. Louis, MO</p>
                    <p> Been around since 1913. The BLT sandwiches are very big and very good. More bacon than a human should eat in a day, or week for that matter. If you have a sweet tooth, the malts are fantastic too.</p>

                    <h2>Vacation Hangout</h2>
                    <a id="tahiti_village"></a>
                    <p>Tahiti Village Resort, Las Vegas, NV</p>
                    <p>When you wake up and find yourself in Las Vegas, then you might as well wake up in a comfortable room with a kitchen and sauna. I have been staying here for Christmas and New Years for the past 15 years. It is always a satifying and comfortable stay.</p>

                    <h2>Great Entertainment</h2>
                    <a id="new_york"></a>
                    <p>New York New York Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, NV</p>
                    <p>Got an itch to lose a few bucks? This place will gladly help you out. But, if you are like me, then there is pleanty of other things to spend your time and money on. From shows to fine dining and drinks with most everything else in between.</p>

                    <h2>Great Shopping</h2>
                    <a id="venetian"></a>
                    <p>Venetian, Las Vegas, NV</p>
                    <p> This is my favorite place to shop when I am staying in Las Vegas. It is indoors and the air conditioning works great when it is over 100 degress outside.  I really like the fake sky that changes brightness throughout the day to simulate a really outdoor experience. You could easily spend an entire day or two in here just looking at the shops.</p>
