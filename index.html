                    <p>Gus' Pretzels, St. Louis, MO<br>
                    When you are near the Anheiser Busch Brewery you should stop in at Gus's pretzels for a quick snack. They taste the best when they are fresh and hot.<br>

                    <p>Crown Candy, St. Louis, MO<br>
                    Been around since 1913. The BLT sandwiches are very big and very good. More bacon than a human should eat in a day, or week for that matter. If you have a sweet tooth, the malts are fantastic too.<br>

                    <p>Tahiti Village Resort, Las Vegas, NV<br>
                    When you wake up and find yourself in Las Vegas, then you might as well wake up in a comfortable room with a kitchen and sauna. I have been staying here for Christmas and New Years for the past 15 years. It is always a satifying and comfortable stay.<br>

                    <p>Venetian, Las Vegas, NV<br>
                    This is my favorite place to shop when I am staying in Las Vegas. It is indoors and the air conditioning works great when it is over 100 degress outside.  I really like the fake sky that changes brightness throughout the day to simulate a really outdoor experience. You could easily spend an entire day or two in here just looking at the shops.<br>
